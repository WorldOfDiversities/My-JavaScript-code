# 🧠 JavaScript Mini Projects

Welcome to my personal JavaScript playground! This repository contains a collection of small, fun, and interactive web apps I built while learning and practicing JavaScript.

Each project demonstrates a specific concept or technique — from DOM manipulation to using public APIs — to build real-world features.
